# MailboxNoRouter

This is an mailbox example application with his own server writen in JS. Is only a showcase experiment, for a real example see the fractalMail example, run this example with:

```
cd Fractal.js
npm run general mailboxNoRouter
```

You can modify the source of data (by default mocked-data.service.js) to data.service.js in index.js, and run the server with:

```
cd examples/mailboxNoRouter
npm i
node server
```

Now the UI notifies you that the server is online.
